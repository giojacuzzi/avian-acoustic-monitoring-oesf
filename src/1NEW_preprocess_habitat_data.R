# Watercourses/waterbodies (rivers and streams) from Type 1-3. These support distinct riparian vegetation which constitutes different habitat. Type 4 (non-fish-bearing streams) and type 5 are not boundaries because they are small features that do not change the vegetation, support less aquatic biota, and often are not permanent.
